    <h1>Showcase of more HTML elements to know!</h1>
    <hr />

    <h2>Horizontal Lines</h2>
    <p>
      This can be done via the HR Element. There is also a Break element.
      <br />
      This can break up content together.
      <br />
      Such as when you want to do a poem.
    </p>

    <h2>Superscripts</h2>
    <p>
      Superscript is done via the sup tag! For example, check this out<sup>
        <a href="https://lyoko.sh">1</a></sup
      >
      Obviously, you can also do a subscript! That's just done via the sub tag,
      which looks <sub>like this!</sub>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>HTML Entities</h2>
    <p>
      They're characters that are tricky to type or maybe reserved.
      <br />
      The less than tag is a good example: 1 &lt; 5.
